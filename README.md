# scheduler
kickball scheduler

scheduler.py attempts to generate a schedule
finder1.sh runs scheduler.py taking a number as an argument which routes the generated schedules in to cands/cand<number>

so executing:
/root_dir/finder1.sh 7
will result in candidate schedules being created in:
/root_dir/cands/cands7
